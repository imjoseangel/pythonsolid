The function animal_sound does not conform to the open-closed principle because
it cannot be closed against new kinds of animals.  If we add a new animal,
Snake, We have to modify the animal_sound function.  You see, for every new
animal, a new logic is added to the animal_sound function.  This is quite a
simple example. When your application grows and becomes complex, you will see
that the if statement would be repeated over and over again in the animal_sound
function each time a new animal is added, all over the application.

Animal now has a virtual method make_sound. We have each animal extend the
Animal class and implement the virtual make_sound method.

Every animal adds its own implementation on how it makes a sound in the
make_sound.  The animal_sound iterates through the array of animal and just
calls its make_sound method.

Now, if we add a new animal, animal_sound doesn’t need to change.  All we need
to do is add the new animal to the animal array.

animal_sound now conforms to the OCP principle.

Another example:

Let’s imagine you have a store, and you give a discount of 20% to your favorite
customers using this class: When you decide to offer double the 20% discount to

"""
No, this fails the OCP principle. OCP forbids it. If we want to give a new
percent discount maybe, to a diff.  type of customers, you will see that a new
logic will be added.

To make it follow the OCP principle, we will add a new class that will extend
the Discount.  In this new class, we would implement its new behavior:

class Discount:

        self.customer = customer
