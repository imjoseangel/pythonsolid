Dependency Inversion Principle

Dependency should be on abstractions not concretions A. High-level modules
should not depend upon low-level modules. Both should depend upon abstractions.
B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend upon
abstractions.

There comes a point in software development where our app will be largely
composed of modules. When this happens, we have to clear things up by using
dependency injection. High-level components depending on low-level components
to function.

class XMLHttpService:
    pass


class Http:
    def __init__(self, xml_http_service: XMLHttpService):
        self.xml_http_service = xml_http_service

    def get(self, url: str, options: dict):
        self.xml_http_service.request(url, 'GET')

    def post(self, url, options: dict):
        self.xml_http_service.request(url, 'POST')


"""
Here, Http is the high-level component whereas XMLHttpService is the low-level
component. This design violates Dependency Inversion Principle A: High-level
modules should not depend on low-level level modules. It should depend upon
its abstraction.

Ths Http class is forced to depend upon the XMLHttpService class.  If we were to
change the Http connection service, maybe we want to connect to the internet
through cURL or even Mock the http service.  We will painstakingly have to move
through all the instances of Http to edit the code and this violates the OCP
principle.

The Http class should care less the type of Http service you are using. We make
a Connection interface:
"""


class Connection:
    def request(self, url: str, options: dict):
        raise NotImplementedError


"""
The Connection interface has a request method. With this, we pass in an argument
of type Connection to our Http class:
"""


class Http:
    def __init__(self, http_connection: Connection):
        self.http_connection = http_connection

    def get(self, url: str, options: dict):
        self.http_connection.request(url, 'GET')

    def post(self, url, options: dict):
        self.http_connection.request(url, 'POST')


"""
So now, no matter the type of Http connection service passed to Http it can
easily connect to a network without bothering to know the type of network
connection.

We can now re-implement our XMLHttpService class to implement the Connection
interface:
"""


class XMLERequestService(Connection):
    def request(self, url: str, options: dict):
        pass


"""
We can create many Http Connection types and pass it to our Http class without
any fuss about errors.
"""


class NodeHttpService(Connection):
    def request(self, url: str, options: dict):
        pass


class MockHttpService(Connection):
    def request(self, url: str, options: dict):
        pass


"""
Now, we can see that both high-level modules and low-level modules depend on
abstractions.  Http class(high level module) depends on the Connection
interface(abstraction) and the Http service types(low level modules) in turn,
depends on the Connection interface(abstraction).

Also, this Dependency Inversion Principle will force us not to violate the Liskov
Substitution Principle:
The Connection types Node-XML-MockHttpService are substitutable for their parent
type Connection.
